# Exploring Jupiter’s moons 
Greeting! As our journey for the Stellar Odyssey continues, we arrived at one of Jupiter’s moons, Europa. Beneath its frozen surface lay a subsurface ocean, concealing the potential for life in its frigid depths. As our robotic probed the icy caverns, they revealed a world teeming with exotic microbial life forms, thriving in the darkness of Europa's hidden ocean. Our next stop was the volcanic moon Io. As we approached Io's turbulent surface, we were greeted by plumes of sulfur dioxide erupting from its numerous volcanoes. The landscape was a stark contrast of vibrant colors, with fiery reds and yellows dominating the landscape. Our probes delved into the heart of these volcanic eruptions, capturing mesmerizing images of molten lava spewing forth from the moon's surface like rivers of fire.
